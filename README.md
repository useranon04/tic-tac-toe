Hi, this comes with a editor version of the game, where you can play 1 or 2 player.

For 1 player, there is only a dumb AI, and i am not so familiar with machine learning and numpy, so if possible, could someone suggest a code for me to use? Thanks.

Also attached is a pygame version, which i have decorated somewhat.

Sorry about the extremely untidy code and complete lack of notes, I've finished both codes in 4 hours.
